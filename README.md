Our choice in this project is the Instagram Viewer. 

We have referenced the open-source YPImagePicker, according to the MIT License, from https://github.com/Yummypets/YPImagePicker.

We were working on two other git repositories before moving to this one. Folder 'instgram' shows the final state of the previous repository, which can be ignored.

Note: Please open the Instragram.xcworkspace file in Xcode instead of opening Instragram.xcworkproj to view and test this project.
